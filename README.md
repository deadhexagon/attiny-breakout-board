This is just a short README. If you're looking for full assembly
instructions or anything not in here, have a look at the full
documentation in the "DOCS" file.

SUMMARY
-------
This is a simple breakout board for Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller,
the ATtiny. It can be used with the ATtiny25, 45, or 85, since all
three chips have the same pinout, but it was designed with the ATtiny85
in mind.

COPYING
-------
Open-source is/should be all about freedom, and some folks have different
ideas about what freedoms you should have, even when you have access
to their source code.

Well, none of that here.

This software is licensed under the WTFPL, or the appropriately titled
"Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License."

This means I really don't care what you do with these files. If you want
to keep them to yourself, modify them, redistribute them, plaster your
name all over them, sell them, burn them, or even make sweet, sweet love
to them. You've got total freedom here, and I promise I won't sue.

Go nuts, as they say.
